Put your name and a brief reflection on what you think of Github! 
Brandon: Github can be confusing but I love how it keeps track of changes! 
This is during the live class! 
Chris Brownell, I see this as a giant mysterious place where the druid gods of the internet reside.
Amy Leung, Github is very new to me, but I like the idea of having another app that share lines of code and text without have information deleted.
